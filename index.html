        Hello, everyone! My name is Tina. I am naming my blog, "Tina Talks". I have a tendency to talk a lot, so, that's why I'm naming it that. 
        On this blog, I will be talking about things I enjoy and what I enjoy doing. Some examples are that, I like to bake (decorate cakes, cupcakes, etc.), cook (especially Vietnamese food) and experiment with making my own coffee. 
        Outside of that, I like to shop, especially stroll down the aisles at Trader Joes, modify my car, collect designer bags, collect makeup, and lastly, spend time with my loved ones. 
        I have a love for cars, and if I'm not modifying my car, I'm looking at ideas of what to do next. I love not only my car, but a variety of beautiful, fast cars, as well as luxury cars.
